I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. <a href="https://nilanjanchatterjee.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nilanjan Chatterjee</a>’s group at the <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Biostatistics</a>, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2019 - 2023. I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities under the supervision of Drs. <a href="https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/joseph-koopmeiners" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Joeseph S. Koopmeiners</a> and <a href="https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/lin-zhang" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lin Zhang</a>. Before that I received my Bachelor’s degree in statistics from the <a href="https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">School of the Gifted Young</a>, University of Science and Technology of China (<a href="https://en.ustc.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">USTC</a>).</p> <p>My research interests focus on developing statistical and computational methods to address cutting-edge problems in public health and medicine by integrating large-scale, multi-source datasets. Within this scope, my research involves health equity in disease risk prediction, statistical genetics, Bayesian hierarchical models for high-dimensional, complex-structured data, and statistical data integration.</p> <p>In February 2022, I received an <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/5u7x8jpqxUSznDKcHnIqSw/project-details/10349828" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)</a> from the National Human Genome Research Institute (<a href="https://www.genome.gov/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NHGRI</a>) as a Principal Investigator for multi-ethnic disease risk prediction integrating multi-source information on genetic and other risk factors. <br>  </p> <h4 id="contact"><strong>Contact</strong></h4> <p>Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Bioinformatics <br> University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine <br> 203 Blockley Hall <br> 423 Guardian Drive, Philadelphia, PA 19104 <br> Email: <a href="mailto:%20Jin.Jin@Pennmedicine.upenn.edu">Jin.Jin@Pennmedicine.upenn.edu</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Link to your social media connections, too.
